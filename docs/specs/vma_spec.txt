=Virtual Machine Archive format (VMA)=

This format contains a header which includes the VM configuration as
binary blobs, and a list of devices (dev_id, name).

The actual VM image data is stored inside extents. An extent contains
up to 64 clusters, and start with a 512 byte header containing
additional information for those clusters.

We use a cluster size of 65536, and use 8 bytes for each
cluster in the header to store the following information:

* 1 byte dev_id (to identity the drive)
* 1 byte not used (reserved)
* 2 bytes zero indicator (mark zero regions (16x4096))
* 4 bytes cluster number

We only store non-zero blocks (such block is 4096 bytes).

Each archive is marked with a uuid. The archive header and all
extent headers includes that uuid and a MD5 checksum (over header
data).
